The reduced chi-square statistic is used extensively in goodness of fit testing. It is defined as the chi-square value divided by the degrees of freedom1. As a general rule, when the variance of the measurement error is known a priori, a reduced chi-square value greater than 1 indicates a poor model fit. A reduced chi-square value less than 1 indicates that the fit has not fully captured the data (or that the error variance has been underestimated). In principle, a value of around 1 indicates that the extent of the match between observations and estimates is in accord with the error variance1.
